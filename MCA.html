        For the first semester, I have the following subjects-

    <ul>
        <li><h3>Discrete Mathematics</h3></li>
        <p> I have done my bachelors from IGNOU in Chemistry Honors. Needless
            to say my understanding of mathematics isn't very strong.
            Thankfully I did revisit mathematics for my preparation
            of NIMCET because of which I am in a better position to
            understand discrete mathematics in this semester.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Computer Architecture and Oraganisation</h3></li>
        <p>While preparing for NIMCET, I did some basic study regarding 
            this subject. Since childhood I have wondered why was RAM memory always in exponential power
            of 2, COA answered that question. And I hope to have my other queries and questions
            answered regarding computers.
        </p>
        <li><h3>C programming</h3></li>
        <p>I studied a little bit of C++ in my 12<sup>th</sup> standard, but 
        got completely out of touch with it during my graduation. I am pretty
        much back at square one. But I am excited to begin my journey again.
        I was always inspired to work on computer and technology. I look 
        forward to getting good at coding. I have started educating myself
        about C language in my free hours.</p>
        <li><h3>Web Development</h3></li>
        <p>By now the trend should be obvious. I had no prior knowledge of 
            web development. Having said that, I am glad <b>Prof. Anirban Chaudhary</b> gave me
            this assignment and I got an opportunity to learn HTML and CSS.
            This experience has taught me that it doesn't matter if i have a 
            non computer background, I still have an opportunity to learn and get 
            good.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Business Communication</h3></li>
        <p>This subject I feel is very important as it will groom us. It will 
        help us to tackle the day to day challenges other than our professional
        skills. It is not enough to be good at programming only, we need to
        be better communicatrs and team players too.</p>
        <li><h3>Operating System</h3></li> 
        Operating System is quite a fascinating topic. It is the first thing that we interact with while accessing 
        the computer. I am very surprised to see how closely related to the real word scenarios, applications 
        and problems the structure of OS is. Thanks to the OS teacher <b>Prof. Vishnu Priya</b>, who has been
        great at relating the real world situations to the functioning of the OS, I have developed a keen interest
        in figuring out the intricacies of functioning of Operating System.
